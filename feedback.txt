# Feedback

We're always looking for ways to improve our hiring and trial system,
to get a good balance of challenge and minimal time and frustration.

We'd love some feedback from you on your experience of the trial project.

## Time and Trial Length

> How did you feel about the length of the trial?
I found it a fair test, it can cover many subjects that a good developer should have.

> Was it too much, or too quick for the effort involved?
Its OK.


## Complexity or Difficulty

> Did you find the difficulty appropriate?
Yes

> Was the trial too easy, too difficult, or just right for the position
Just right for the position

> you feel you are applying for?
> (Your answer here is _not_ used to judge you as a candidate, only
>  to improve our trial process)


## Any Other Thoughts?

I wanted first to thank you for taking this test.
It was really cool to solve a challenge from a company that I've had the pleasure of using the products a lot.

If I could make a suggestion of improvement, I had to disable ROBOTSTXT_OBEY, maybe it wouldn't be necessary


## Thanks!

We want to make things informative, fun, and fast. Hopefully we can get
better with your advice and feedback.
