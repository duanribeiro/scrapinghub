# Put your assumptions here

My first decision happens to decide which "start_urls" I will use.

Normally I would only use the endpoints: "/insunsh" and "/summertime", but as it seems to me that navigation
is part of the exercise I will use the endpoint: "/browse"

I may not have understood the correct form if I do the "Categorie" field, so I only enter the last value
of the category.
